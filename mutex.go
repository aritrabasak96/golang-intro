/**
  Mutex: Mutual exclusion lock
  Sometimes itâ€™s more convenient to synchronize data access by explicit locking.

  Why we use lock => to avoid clashes. (If you have one ticket available and two user come at the same time
  then there will be a clash in it. To avoid this we use lock)

  Mutex{} = in a simple mutex it's just lock or unlock. only one thing can access at a time (lock and unlock)
  RWMutex{} = as many can read at a time but only one can write at a time. If anything is reading then we can't write it at a time

  ... for read lock and unlock -> mu.RLock() & mu.RUnlock()
  ... for write lock and unlock -> mu.Lock() & mu.Unlock()
