## go modules and packages 

when you want to create a new package in golang, it will be a good practice that you place all your packages in a repository like github or gitlab 

```
   create a github account
   
   --------------- mypackages
   .git
    package1
        ------- pac.go
        ------- pac2.go
        ------- pac3.go
        
    package2
        ------- pac4.go
        ------- pac5.go
        ------- pac6.go

```

### Create Release using git

``` bash 
    
    git inti
    git add .
    git commit -m ""
    
    git tag # to check all your checkpoints
    git tag v1.0.0  # add checkpoint (this is how you create a version of every release)
    
    git push origin v1.0.0  # from a specific branch upload code 
    git push origin master  # push code from master branch
    
    git push origin --tags # add all the tags 
    
    git tag -d v1.0.0   # to delete a specific tags from local repo
    git push origin -d v1.0.0   # delete tags from public repo
    
    # create tag from previous commit 
    git log   # to check all the previous commit 
    git tag v1.0.3 e456ty6y     # e456ty6y is the commit id 
    

```

## Undo or reverting changes 

```bash
    
    # lets imagine that you have a file -> myfile.txt
    # you add some content 
    # and now you want to undo it 
    git status
    git checkout -- myfile.txt   # this command will undo your previos release
    git checkout -- .     # undo all your files if you have many changes 
    
    # reverting to a previous commit 
    git log
    git revert <commit-id>
    
    # now do your changes 
    git add .
    git commit -m "bug fixes"   # a new release added
    
    
    # delete previous commit and move to old commit 
    git log
    git reset --hard <commit-id>   # all the commit after this <commit-id> will be deleted
    

```
